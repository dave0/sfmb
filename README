sfmb - Single File Markdown Blog
================================

This is a quick and dirty blog script, written with the following requirements:

   1. One file
   1. Posting via text files with minimal markup

It is likely not suitable for high-traffic implementations, as it runs as a
Perl CGI.  It is also not suitable if you want commenting, web-based posting,
etc.  In fact, it's probably not suitable for much, which is why I no longer
use it, but YMMV.

Usage
-----

Clone the repository.  Then:

  cp _blog ~/.blog
  cp blog.pl /var/www/some/cgi/directory

and you're deployed.

Of course, it will have no posts and look ugly as sin, as the defaults are
horrible and likely point to the wrong paths.  So....

    mkdir ~/.blog/entries
    ~/.blog/blog_new

and compose an entry in your editor.

Then:

    $EDITOR /var/www/some/cgi/directory/blog.pl

and modify the `$conf` section appropriately.  You will at minimum want to
point data_dir to your $HOME/.blog/entries.

Now would also be a good time to adjust templates, CSS, etc, at the bottom of
blog.pl
