1) Needs a configuration file:
	< bartman> dave0: can you give me the YAML patch for vimblog?

2) Previous/next article arrows
	< bartman> dave0: I want three features next: previous/next arrows
	
DONE 3) Allow tags in a Tags: header	
	< bartman> tagging via a entries/* Tags: line (tag file would be pregenerated by cron calling make -C .blog/Makefile tags), 
	- Generates tag info on-the-fly, since we're reading every article
	  anyway.  No makefile necessary
	  
DONE 3a) Show tags in "tag cloud" style, with frequent tags being larger

DONE 4) Allow nice link names via Alias: header
	< bartman> and article alias names for the YYYYMMDDHHMMSS given in entries/* Alias:

5) Allow history.  Right now we ignore anything older than 6 months, and
   display everything else.  What we should do is allow viewing on a per-month
   basis.
   	- we can now specify date URLS as any of:
		/date/YYYY
		/date/YYYY/MM
		/date/YYYY/MM/DD
	  and see articles for that year, month, or day. 
	- next task is to show a sidebar listing available year/month history.

6) See if there's a way to have both inline templates BUT allow them to be
   overridden by a templates directory if present.
